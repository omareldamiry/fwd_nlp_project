# **NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSOR**

###### *by Omar Eldamiry*

This project uses the *MeaningCloud* API to process articles using the article's URL.

This project uses webpack to bundle the source files with two different configurations: development and production configurations. Each is set up in its own `webpack.config.js` file.

**Do not forget to set up the `.env` file with an `API_KEY`
